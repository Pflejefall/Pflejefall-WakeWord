# Pflejefall Wake Word

This repository contains a custom wake word model for the Pflejefall project. The wake word "Pflejefall" is designed to activate voice-controlled applications on ESPHome voice assistants.

This is a work in progress. Steps to reproduce the model training will be documented here, as soon as the model is stable enough for use.
